On 11 December 2025, I attended the ASEAN Quantum Summit at Universiti Teknologi Malaysia. It let me knew that how quantum technology applied in our daily life. I learnt that quantum computers don't just work faster, they use special principles to solve problems compared to regular computers while quantum communication can make data more secure. Besides, I have also learnt about the quantum sensing, which showed me that the quantum technology is much broader than I expected.

I was inspired by the talk to keep following the developments in quantum technology. It also made me more interested in the field of quantum technology, it has opened my eyes and widened my vision.
